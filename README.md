This tool allows users to perform encryption and decryption on images using XOR-based encryption. It provides an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) built with Python's `Tkinter` library for easy interaction. The tool supports the following features:

## Features:
- **Choose Image:** Load an image from your local system.
- **Encrypt Image:** Encrypt the selected image using a randomly generated encryption key. The encryption is based on XOR operations.
- **Decrypt Image:** Decrypt the encrypted image back to its original form using the same encryption key.
- **Reset Image:** Reset the image to its original format if needed.
- **Save Image:** Save the encrypted or decrypted image to a location of your choice.
- **Exit:** Exit the application.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- `Tkinter` for GUI
- `Pillow` for image manipulation
- `OpenCV` for image processing
- `NumPy` for array operations

## Installation:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RoNiXxCybSeC0101/PRODIGY_CS_TASK2.git
